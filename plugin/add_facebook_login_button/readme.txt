This plugin adds a button to allow users to log into Chamilo with their Facebook account.<br/><br/>
To display this button on your portal, you have to enable the Facebook authentification and configure it.<br/>
To enable and configure the Facebook authentification on your Chamilo platform, go to Administration > Configuration settings > Facebook<br/>
This plugin has been developed to be added to the login_top or login_bottom region in Chamilo, but you can put it in whichever region you want.<br/>
