<h1>Chamilo LMS: Security Guide</h1>

<a href="index.html">Documentation</a> &gt; Security Guide

<p>We recommend you don't take security issues too lightly. Chamilo is security-audited at least once a year, but you're never too sure. This list is a work in progress. Feel free to recommend additional measures by sending us an e-mail at info@chamilo.org.</p>

<h2><a name="1.Disclosing-server-info"></a>1. Disclosing server info</h2>
<p>
It is considered a safer behaviour not to disclose server information from your Chamilo page. In order to avoid both web server and PHP information disclosure, you might want to take the following actions:
<ul>
<li>Locate the <i>ServerTokens</i> setting inside your Apache configuration and set it to "Prod"</li>
<li>Locate the <i>ServerSignature</i> setting inside your Apache configuration and set it to "Off"</li>
<li>Locate the <i>expose_php</i> setting inside your PHP configuration and set it to "Off"</li>
<li>Reload Apache</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="3.Using-safe-browsers"></a>3. Using safe browsers</h2>
<p> Additionnally to lacking the implementation of features that really improve the quality of your browsing the Internet, older browsers tend to have many unresolved security flaws. Using an old browser, you put in danger the security of your computer and the data it contains, but you can also put others in danger by letting crackers take control of it and attacking others.</p>
<p>To  avoid being a risk to yourself and others, you should download and install a recent browser. We recommend <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">the latest stable version of Firefox</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="4.Moving-config-file"></a>4. Moving your configuration file out of the web directory</h2>
<p>It is considered unsafe to leave the configuration file inside the main/inc/conf/ directory, as it will be directly accessible for all users, which could lead crackers to download it, uninterpreted, and read through your configuration, which could lead to illicit 
access to your database if that one isn't well protected and many other stuff we'd prefer to avoid. To secure it, move the configuration file out of your web directory. If your
Chamilo installation is in /var/www/, move your configuration to /etc/chamilo/configuration.php, for example. Then create a new main/inc/conf/configuration.php file, open it, and write the following:</p>
<p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
require '/etc/chamilo/configuration.php';
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This will prevent direct access to your settings and make it seem totally the same to Chamilo.
