 * Script to export the current path as a SCORM zip package.

 * the headers clean of any session prior to output-ing the resulting file.
 * As we still need to check the user's credentials (because he might not have access to this file),
 * we need to get some ID proof.
 * Once the ID is checked with the database info, generate the file, send the corresponding headers
 * to force the download and let the user do the rest. This script should not change the screen
 * at all, so the user will still be able to continue what he was doing.
