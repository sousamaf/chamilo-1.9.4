Your only concern\n must be that your users have the corresponding software to read them.\n Some file types can contain viruses, it is your responsibilty not to\n upload virus contaminated files, unless your portal admin has installed a server side anti=virus software. \n It is, anyway, a worthwhile precaution to check documents with\n antivirus software before uploading them.</p>\n<p>The documents are presented in alphabetical order.<br><br><b>Tip : </b>If\n you want to present them in a different order, numerate them: 01, 02,\n 03... Or use the Learning Path to present a sophisticated Table of Contents. Note that once your documents are uploaded, you may decide to hide the documents area and show only one page on Home page (Add link on home page orange tool) or a Learning Path containing some documents from your Documents area.</p>\n<p>You can :</p>\n<H4>Create a document</H4>\n<p>Select Create a document > Give it a title (no spaces, no accents) > type your text > Use the buttons of the Wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) editor to structure information, create tables, styles etc. To create web pages, you will need to get familiar with 3 concepts : Links, Images and Tables. Note that web pages offer less layout possibilities than Ms-Word pages. Note too that instead of creating a document in the editor, you can also cut and paste existing content from a web page or a Word document. This is an easy and quick way to migrate content onto your Chamilo course.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>To add a link</b>, you need to copy the URL of the target somewhere. We suggest that you open 2 browser windows simultaneously, one with your chamilo course and the other to browse the web. Once you find the page you are looking for (note that this page can be inside your chamilo course), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C), go back to your page editor, select the word that will be the link, click on the small chain icon, paste the URL of your target there and validate. Once your page is saved, test the link to see if it opens the target. Note that you can decide in the Link popup menu if the link will create a new page or replace your chamilo page in the same window.</li>\n<li><b>To add an image</b>, the principle is similar to the link feature : browse the web with a 2nd window, find the image (if the image is inside your course's documents area, select 'No frames' to get the image only and not the context), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C in the URL bar after selecting the whole URL) then go back to your web page editor, position your mouse in the form where you want your image to appear, then click on the small tree icon and copy the URL of the target image into the URL field, Preview and validate. Note that in web pages, you can not redimension your images like in a PowerPoint presentation, neither can you re-locate the image anywhere in the page.</li>\n<li><b>To add a table</b>, position your mouse in the field where you want the table to appear, then select the table icon in the Wysiwyg editor menu, decide for a number of columns and lines and validate. To get nice tables, we suggest that you choose the following values : border=1, cellspacing=0, cellpadding=4. Note that you will not be allowed to redimension your table or add lines or columns to it after its creation (sorry about this, it is just an online editor, not a word processor yet).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Upload a document</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Select the file on your computer using the Browse button <input\n type=submit value=Browse name=submit2>\n\ton the right of your screen.</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\tLaunch the upload with the Upload Button <input type=submit value=Upload name=submit2>.\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\tCheck the checkbox under the Upload button if your document is zip file or a so-called <b>Scorm content</b>.

$langPathContent = "The Learning Path tool has two functions :\n<ul><li>Create a learning Path</li>\n<li>Upload a Scorm or IMS format Learning path</li></ul>\n<img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\">\n<p><b>\nWhat is a Learning Path ?</b>\n</p><p>A Learning Path is a sequence of learning steps included in modules. It can be content-based (looking like a table of contents) or activities-based, looking like an agenda or a programme of what you need to do in order to understand and practice a certain knowledge or know-how.</p><p>In addition to being structured, a learning path can also be sequenced. This means that some steps will constitute pre-requisites for others ('you cannot go to step 2 before step1'). Your sequence can be suggestive (you show steps one after the other) or imperative (you add pre-requisites so that people are forced to follow the sequence).\n</p>\n<p><b>How to create our own Learning Path ?</b></p>\n<p>\nThe first step is to arrive to Learning Path Builder section. In\nthe Learning Path screen, there is a link to it. There you can create\nmany paths by clicking onto <i>Add a new learning path</i>. But they are\nempty, till you add modules and steps to them.<br>If you make a path\nvisible, it will appear as a new tool on the homepage of the course. This\nway their access is easier.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are the steps for these paths ? (What are the items that can be added?)</b></p>\n<p>All Chamilo tools, activities and contents that you consider to be useful and connected to your\nimagined path can be added :<br><ul>\n<li>Agenda items</li>\n<li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li>\n<li>Announcement items</li>\n<li>Forums as a whole</li>\n<li>Topics</li>\n<li>Individual topic messages</li>\n<li>Links</li>\n<li>Dokeos Tests</li>\n<li>HotPotatoes Tests\n<br>(note : those invisible tests, that you put in a path, become visible for students, but only in the Path tool)</li>\n<li>Assignments page</li>\n<li>Dropbox page</li>\n<li>External links, which point out of Chamilo system</li></ul>\n</p>\n<p><b>\nOther features of Learning Path</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nStudents can be asked to follow (read) your path in a given order, as you\ncan set <u>prerequisities</u> in the path. This means that for example students\ncannot go to Quiz 2 till they have read Document 1. All items have a status :\ncompleted or incomplete, so the progress of students is clearly available.\n</p><p>\nIf you alter the original title of a step, the new title will appear in\nthe path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want\ntest8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename\nthe file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful\nto give new titles to links as they are too long.\n</p><p>\nWhen finished, do not forget to check the student view, where the table of\ncontents appears on the left and the path steps usually appear on the right,\none by one.\n</p><br><p><b>\nWhat is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant course\ncontents.</p>\n<p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning actors\nlike NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. and acting at three levels:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Economy</b> : Scorm allows whole courses or small content\nunits to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)\nthrough the separation of content and context,</li>\n<li><b>Pedagogy</b> : Scorm integrates the notion of\npre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You\ncannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li>\n<li><b>Technology</b> : Scorm generates a table of contents as\nan\nabstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. It\nhelps content and LMS communicate with each\nother. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks\n</i>(\"Where is John in the\ncourse?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much\ntime did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li>\n</ul>\n<b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br>\n<br>\nThe most natural way is to use the Chamilo Learning Path Builder. However, you may want to create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like Lectoraï¿½ or Reloadï¿½\n<br></p><p>\n<b>Useful links</b><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Adlnet : authority responsible for Scorm normalisation, <a\nhref=\"http://www.adlnet.org/\">http://www.adlnet.org</a></li>\n<li>Reload : Open Source free Scorm player and editor, <a\nhref=\"http://www.reload.ac.uk/\">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a></li>\n<li>Lectora : Scorm publisher authoring software, <a\nhref=\"http://www.trivantis.com/\">http://www.trivantis.com</a><br>\n<li>HotPotatoes home page, \n<a href=\"http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/\">http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/</a><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>\nNote :</b></p><p>\nThe Learning Path section lists all the <i>self-built Learning Paths</i>\nand all uploaded <i>Scorm format Learning Paths</i>, as well.\n</p>";

However, if this participates to your scenario, the chat can help. You can imagine, for instance, to hide the chat always except at a certain time when you have a dedicated meeting with your students to answer their questions live.

Keep files invisible if e.g. you ask the same question to everybody and want to avoid cheating.</p>\n<p>This tool has an <i>Introduction text</i> area to allow you to write a question, detailed guidelines, a reminder of a deadline or anything else you may find relevant.</p>";

You will not be allowed to restore it yourself but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your course.
