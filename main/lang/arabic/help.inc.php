$langDocContent = "<p>The Documents tool is similar to the FileManager of your desktop computer.</p><p>You can create simple web pages ('Create a document') or upload files of any type (HTML, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Acrobat, Flash, Quicktime, etc.). Your only concern must be that your users have the corresponding software to read them. Some file types can contain viruses, it is your responsibilty not to upload virus contaminated files, unless your portal admin has installed a server side anti=virus software.  It is, anyway, a worthwhile precaution to check documents with antivirus software before uploading them.</p><p>The documents are presented in alphabetical order.<br /><br /><b>Tip : </b>If you want to present them in a different order, numerate them: 01, 02, 03... Or use the Learning Path to present a sophisticated Table of Contents. Note that once your documents are uploaded, you may decide to hide the documents area and show only one page on Home page (Add link on home page orange tool) or a Learning Path containing some documents from your Documents area.</p><p>You can :</p><H4>Create a document</H4><p>Select Create a document > Give it a title (no spaces, no accents) > type your text > Use the buttons of the Wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) editor to structure information, create tables, styles etc. To create web pages, you will need to get familiar with 3 concepts : Links, Images and Tables. Note that web pages offer less layout possibilities than Ms-Word pages. Note too that instead of creating a document in the editor, you can also cut and paste existing content from a web page or a Word document. This is an easy and quick way to migrate content onto your Chamilo course.</p><ul><li><b>To add a link</b>, you need to copy the URL of the target somewhere. We suggest that you open 2 browser windows simultaneously, one with your chamilo course and the other to browse the web. Once you find the page you are looking for (note that this page can be inside your chamilo course), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C), go back to your page editor, select the word that will be the link, click on the small chain icon, paste the URL of your target there and validate. Once your page is saved, test the link to see if it opens the target. Note that you can decide in the Link popup menu if the link will create a new page or replace your chamilo page in the same window.</li><li><b>To add an image</b>, the principle is similar to the link feature : browse the web with a 2nd window, find the image (if the image is inside your course's documents area, select 'No frames' to get the image only and not the context), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C in the URL bar after selecting the whole URL) then go back to your web page editor, position your mouse in the form where you want your image to appear, then click on the small tree icon and copy the URL of the target image into the URL field, Preview and validate. Note that in web pages, you can not redimension your images like in a PowerPoint presentation, neither can you re-locate the image anywhere in the page.</li><li><b>To add a table</b>, position your mouse in the field where you want the table to appear, then select the table icon in the Wysiwyg editor menu, decide for a number of columns and lines and validate. To get nice tables, we suggest that you choose the following values : border=1, cellspacing=0, cellpadding=4. Note that you will not be allowed to redimension your table or add lines or columns to it after its creation (sorry about this, it is just an online editor, not a word processor yet).</li></ul><h4>Upload a document</h4><ul>  <li>Select the file on your computer using the Browse button <input type=submit value=Browse name=submit2>\ton the right of your screen.</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\tLaunch the upload with the Upload Button <input type=submit value=Upload name=submit2>.\t\t</li>\t\t<li>\t\t\tCheck the checkbox under the Upload button if your document is zip file or a so-called <b>Scorm content</b>.

(What are the items that can be added?)</b></p><p>All Chamilo tools, activities and contents that you consider to be useful and connected to yourimagined path can be added :<br /><ul><li>Agenda items</li><li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li><li>Announcement items</li><li>Forums as a whole</li><li>Topics</li><li>Individual topic messages</li><li>Links</li><li>Dokeos Tests</li><li>HotPotatoes Tests<br />(note : those invisible tests, that you put in a path, become visible for students, but only in the Path tool)</li><li>Assignments page</li><li>Dropbox page</li><li>External links, which point out of Chamilo system</li></ul></p><p><b>Other features of Learning Path</b></p><p>Students can be asked to follow (read) your path in a given order, as youcan set <u>prerequisities</u> in the path. This means that for example studentscannot go to Quiz 2 till they have read Document 1. All items have a status :completed or incomplete, so the progress of students is clearly available.</p><p>If you alter the original title of a step, the new title will appear inthe path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you wanttest8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to renamethe file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also usefulto give new titles to links as they are too long.</p><p>When finished, do not forget to check the student view, where the table ofcontents appears on the left and the path steps usually appear on the right,one by one.</p><br /><p><b>What is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it?</b></p><p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant coursecontents.</p><p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning actorslike NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. and acting at three levels:</p><ul><li><b>Economy</b> : Scorm allows whole courses or small contentunits to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)through the separation of content and context,</li><li><b>Pedagogy</b> : Scorm integrates the notion ofpre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"Youcannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li><li><b>Technology</b> : Scorm generates a table of contents asanabstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. Ithelps content and LMS communicate with eachother. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks</i>(\"Where is John in thecourse?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How muchtime did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li></ul><b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br /><br />The most natural way is to use the Chamilo Learning Path Builder. However, you may want to create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your chamilo platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like Lectora or Reload<br /></p><p><b>Useful links</b><br /><ul><li>Adlnet : authority responsible for Scorm normalisation, <ahref=\"http://www.adlnet.org/\">http://www.adlnet.org</a></li><li>Reload : Open Source free Scorm player and editor, <ahref=\"http://www.reload.ac.uk/\">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a></li><li>Lectora : Scorm publisher authoring software, <ahref=\"http://www.trivantis.com/\">http://www.trivantis.com</a><br /><li>HotPotatoes home page, <a href=\"http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/\">http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/</a><br /></li></ul><p><b>Note :</b></p><p>The Learning Path section lists all the <i>self-built Learning Paths</i>and all uploaded <i>Scorm format Learning Paths</i>, as well.</p>";
$langDescriptionContent = "<p>This tool will help you describe your course in a synthetic way and from the outside. It may help your future students get a clear view on what they can expect from this course. It is also an opportunity for you to rethink your course scenario.</p>Items are given here as proposals. If you want to create a course description with your own items, use only the 'Other' item and decide for its title.</p><p>To fill the course description, select Create and edit with forms > Scrolldown menu and select the item of your choice > fill the form > Validate. You can always edit or delete the content of every item by clicking on the pencil or red cross icons.</p>";
$langLinksContent = "<p>The Links tool allows you to create a library of resources for your students.

You can edit every link to re-assign it into a new category (you need to create this category first).</p><p>The Description field can be used to give pre-information on the target web pages but also to describe what you expect the student to do with the link. If, for instance, you point to a website on Aristotle, the description field may ask the student to study the difference between synthesis and analysis.";
$langMycoursesContent = "<p>Once logged in into the platform, you are in your <i>personal startpage</i>.</p><p>In the main area (center) you see \"<b>My course list</b>\", a list of all your courses.

$langAgendaContent = "<p>The agenda appears both in each course area and as a synthetic tool for the student ('My agenda' in top banner).</p><p>In the course, the agenda appears as a list of events. You can attach documents or activities to a date so that the agenda becomes a chronological programme for your learning activities.</p><p>In addition to being present in the agenda, the new events are indicated to the student when he/she logs in the next time. The system tells what has been added in the Agenda (and in the Announcements) since his/her last visit : icons appear on the portal home page besides the courses where events and announcements hve been added.</p><p>If you want to go further in the logic of structuring learning activities one after the other, we suggest that you use preferably the Learning Path that offers the same principles with more advanced features. The Learning Path can be considered as a synthesis of a Table of Contens tool + an Agenda + sequencing (imposed order) and tracking.</p>";
$langAnnouncementsContent = "<p>The Announcements tool allows you to send an email to all your students or to some of them or to some groups.

$langChatContent = "<p>The Chat tool allows you to discuss live with your students.</p><p>This chat is not similar to usual ones, like MSN or Yahoo Messenger because it is web based. The disadvantage is that it refreshes only after 10 seconds and not immediately. The advantage is that it is integrated in your course,it archives your discussions into the Documents tool and it doesn't require from your students any plugin to download.</p><p>If users send their pictures in 'My e-portfolio' (top banner), then this picture will appear in the discussion to help identify who is speaking.</p><p>Only the teacher is allowed to delete the discussion when he/she finds it relevant.</p><p><b>Pedagogical relevance</b></p><p>Adding a chat to your course is not necessarily a good idea. However, if this participates to your scenario, the chat can help. You can imagine, for instance, to hide the chat always except at a certain time when you have a dedicated meeting with your students to answer their questions live. It is less a 'free' dicsussion tool this way, but you give students a guarantee that they will benefit from this live meeting.</p>";
$langWorkContent = "<p>The student publications tool is a very simple one. It allows your students to upload any document in the course area.</p><p>Depending on your course scenario, you can set all files to be visible to all students by default, or only visible for you. Making all files visible is useful when for instance you want to ask students to give their opinion on each other's papers or let them learn to publish texts to the world. Keep files invisible if e.g. you ask the same question to everybody and want to avoid cheating.</p><p>This tool has an <i>Introduction text</i> area to allow you to write a question, detailed guidelines, a reminder of a deadline or anything else you may find relevant.</p>";

The trackinggives information at 2 levels:<ul><li><b>Globally</b>: How many students access the course?

This way you keep control of who is in byt you don't have the administrative hassle of registrating them yourself.</p><p>At the bottom of the page, you can Backup the course and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally. So that there will be 2 backups of it in different places. If you backup a course then delete it. You will not be allowed to restore it yourself but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your course. Backuping a course is also a good way to get all your documents back onto your own computer. You will need a tool, like Winzip to UNZIP the archive.

These links can be of 2 types:<ul><li><b>External link</b>: you create on your home page a link to a website situated outside your course area.
