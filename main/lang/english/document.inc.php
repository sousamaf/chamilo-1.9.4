In the case of groups, files that are sent through the editor will be added in the folder of each group, which is only accessible by students from this group.
<br /><br />
The users folder and each of the included folders will be hidden by default in for all students, but each student can see the contents of his/her directory through the online editor. However, if a student knows the address of a file or folder of another student, he may be able to access it.
<br /><br />
If the folder of a student is visible, other students can see what it contains. In this case, the student that owns the folder can also (from the documents tool and only in his/her folder): create and edit web documents, convert a document into a template for personal use, create and edit drawings in SVG and PNG formats, record audio files in WAV format, make audio files in MP3 from a text, make snapshops from a webcam, send documents, create folders, move folders and files, delete folders and files, and download backup of his/her folder.
<br /><br />
Moreover, the documents tool is synchronized with the file manager of the online editor, so changes in the documents triggered in any one of these will affect both.
<br /><br />
As such, the user folder is not only a place to deposit files, it becomes a complete manager of the documents students use during the course.
