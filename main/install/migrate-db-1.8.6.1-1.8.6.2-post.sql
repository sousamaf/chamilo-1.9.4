-- This script updates the databases structure after migrating the data from
-- version 1.8.6.1 to version 1.8.6.2
-- it is intended as a standalone script, however, because of the multiple
-- databases related difficulties, it should be parsed by a PHP script in
-- order to connect to and update the right databases.
-- There is one line per query, allowing the PHP function file() to read
-- all lines separately into an array. The xxMAINxx-type markers are there
-- to tell the PHP script which database we're talking about.
-- By always using the keyword "TABLE" in the queries, we should be able
-- to retrieve and modify the table name from the PHP script if needed, which
-- will allow us to deal with the unique-database-type installations
--
-- This first part is for the main database

ALTER TABLE session_rel_course DROP COLUMN id_coach;

-- xxSTATSxx
