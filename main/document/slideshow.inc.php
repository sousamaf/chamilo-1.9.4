/**
 * 
 * Description:
	This is a plugin for the documents tool. It looks for .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png
	files (since these are the files that can be viewed in a browser) and creates
	a slideshow with it by allowing to go to the next/previous image.
	You can also have a quick overview (thumbnail view) of all the images in
	that particular folder.
	Maybe it is important to notice that each slideshow is folder based. Only
	the images of the chosen folder are shown.

	This file has two large sections.
	1. code that belongs in document.php, but to avoid clutter I put the code here
	2. the function resize_image that handles the image resizing
