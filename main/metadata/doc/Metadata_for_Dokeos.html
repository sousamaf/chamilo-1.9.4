<h1>Metadata for Dokeos 1.6</h1>
<div align="right">document version:2005/09/20.<br>
</div>
<br>
This is a short technical documentation about the metadata (MD)
implementation in Dokeos 1.6. The 1.6 implementation (DMD1.6) mainly
consists of:<br>
<ul>
  <li>screens and scripts for document-MD viewing and editing;</li>
  <li>two XML-related libraries;</li>
  <li>a general MD toolkit with some API functions;</li>
  <li>experimental scripts for search via MD and for getting statistics
on keyword usage;</li>
  <li>not fully supported scripts for indexing and searching MD with
PhpDig;<br>
  </li>
  <li>not fully supported scripts for storing/editing MD related to
Links;<br>
  </li>
  <li>not fully supported scripts for SCORM package metadata import
and custom browsing (see end of document).</li>
</ul>
Background information can be found on&nbsp;<a
 href="http://zephyr.ugent.be/courses/TW05DBRH/">Zephyr</a>:
VeloMetadataClaroline.doc (via Documenten, Metadata). (That document
is, however, outdated where it
describes the implementation.)<br>
<br>
<h2>Metadata, XML, MD table</h2>
MD is XML-formatted information about a Dokeos object. It is stored in
a course database table (not globally), and Dokeos objects are
identified in that table by their type + '.' + id. For example,
'Document.12'
refers to an object
of type 'Document' (a file or a folder in the Dokeos Documents tool).<br>
<br>
The design of DMD1.6 allows to define, per type of object, which info
is to be stored as MD, and how the MD is represented in XML. Both can
be
adapted relatively easily, in a PHP-script that defines the object
class
'mdobject' for the object type at hand.<br>
<br>
DMD1.6 fully implements MD definition, storage and editing for
'Document'-type
objects. The class 'mdobject' for these type of objects is defined in
the script 'md_document.php'. The class definition includes a method
to generate the default MD for new entries. (The scripts 'md_link.php'
and 'md_scorm.php' define the class 'mdobject' for 'Link'- and
'Scorm'-type objects. Script 'md_mix.php' defines a subset of the
'mdobject' class functionality for the experimental Search script.)<br>
<br>
DMD1.6 works with standard IEEE LOM (Learning Objects MD). The
XML-representation
conforms to SCORM 1.3 (also known as SCORM 2004). The IEEE LOM elements
General.Identifier.Catalog
and .Entry are made to contain a globally unique object identifier of
the
form urn:institution:platform.coursecode.type.id and for element
Technical.Location an URL is generated that points to script
'openobject.php', also part of DMD1.6.<br>
<br>
To make changes to type and representation of MD more easy, the
'mdobject' class also defines a map for the (generally accepted) Dublin
Core elements. A specific Dokeos installation can thereby adapt
DMD1.6 relatively easily e.g. to use SCORM 1.2 and/or IMS-XML instead
of SCORM 2004.<br>
<br>
MD is stored in the (new) course database table 'metadata'. Count on
2-4 KB per metadata record.<br>
<br>
The MD records currently have 5 fields: eid (entry-id or object
identifier),
mdxmltext (metadata text, XML-formatted), md5, htmlcache1, htmlcache2,
indexabletext. The latter three fields are used for cached HTML and for
storing text to be indexed for search; the hash-value md5 is used to
validate
the cache.<br>
<br>
The script
'md_funcs', part of the MD toolkit, and used a.o. in the index and
search
scripts, contains a class definition 'mdstore', which handles all
database operations. Code
that is shared by several other scripts is also to be found in
'md_funcs.php': common functions, code related to IEEE, and code
related
to the keyword tree (see below).<br>
<br>
<h2>XMD and XHT</h2>
Two new libraries in inc/lib are essential for DMD1.6: the XML Mini-DOM
'xmd' and XML HTML Templates 'xht'. The corresponding scripts contain
some comments describing their functionality. Test scripts are included
in DMD1.6
to demonstrate the use of these libraries.<br>
<br>
DOM XML functions are also available in PHP 4 itself, but they are
experimental. They require an extra
nonstandard XML library and, on Windows, fiddling with DLLs. To avoid
these problems, DMD1.6 comes with its own XML Mini-DOM library.<br>
<br>
Several open source template libraries exist for PHP, and yet DMD1.6
again comes with its own one. The main design goal for the XML HTML
Templates library is
to combine HTML separation and a tight connection with an XML
(mini-dom-)document. These
are essential, given the goal of flexibility concerning kind and
representation of MD and presentation to the user. The 'xht' library
is mainly used to generate HTML, but DMD1.6 also uses it to generate
XML
(e.g. the default XML for new MD records in 'md_document.php') and
JavaScript (in 'md_funcs.php').<br>
<br>
If it is decided for a future version of Dokeos to use a more
'standard'
approach for XML and/or for templates (e.g. Smarty), then DMD will
most
probably be adapted.<br>
<br>
The use of 'xht' in DMD1.6 allows to define, per type of object,
what part of the MD is to be shown to a Dokeos user or presented for
editing, and how
that info is rendered as HTML (between the page header and footer).
For 'Document'-type objects, the HTML templates for MD viewing and
editing are to be found in 'md_document.htt'. (Compare them with the
templates in 'md_link.htt', 'md_scorm.htt' (both not fully supported),
and 'mds_mix.htt'., the
templates used when rendering the (experimental)
search screen.)<br>
<br>
Some little notes here will come in handy for easier understanding of
the templates. For more info, look into the
source code of the libraries.<br>
<ul>
  <small> <li>A&nbsp;template starts with a special comment line
giving the
template name. A template ends where the next one starts.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Templates can call other templates, example "<span class="code">{-C
LANGSELECT-}</span>" (a "call" construct).</li>
  <li>Calls do not have parameters. Instead, there is a global
parameter array. String values are stored in it with the "define
construct", e.g. "<span class="code">{-D label Language-}</span>"
(define "label" to have the value "Language"). Parameter values are
fetched with the "parameter" construct, e.g. "<span class="code">{-P
title-}</span>".&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Some parameters are predefined, e.g. "<span class="code">{-P 0-}</span>"
('0'), "<span class="code">{-P 1-}</span>", "<span class="code">{-P
empty-}</span>" (empty string). When another literal values needs to be
used in a construct, put it in a parameter, e.g. "<span class="code">{-D
XML application/xml;iso-8859-1-}</span>" </li>
  <li>The "language" construct "<span class="code">{-L KwHelp-}</span>"
includes the value of a language variable from a Dokeos language file
(here: $langKwHelp). (To be correct, it calls the function that has
been assigned to xht_get_lang, usually get_lang.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The "XML construct", e.g. "<span class="code">{-X
technical/format-}</span>" fetches a value from the associated XML
document (in DMD1.6 most often the metadata of a Dokeos object).</li>
  <li>The "test construct", e.g. "<span class="code">{-T key ==
selvalue selected-}</span>" provides conditional inclusion. Our
example: include
the word "selected" only when parameter "key" is equal to parameter
"selvalue".</li>
  <li>Constructs can span several lines, but special care is required
for correct spacing. See examples with the test construct in
'md_document.htt': the space at the end of an unclosed "<span
 class="code">{-T ...</span>" line is essential!</li>
  <li>The "repeat construct", e.g. "<span class="code">{-R Langs C
OPTION-}</span>" repeatedly calls a subtemplate. In this example, the
subtemplate "OPTION" is repeated for all values in the associative list
$langLangs. (Sample associative lists can be found in <span
 class="code">lang/english/md_document.inc.php</span>
Another example: "<span class="code">{-R general/keyword C
KEYWORD-}</span>" - repeat "KEYWORD" for all XML elements found by the
given path "general/keyword".</li>
  <li>Constructs can be nested such as in e.g. "<span class="code">{-H
{-L {-P label-}Tip-}-}</span>". </li>
  <li>The "X" construct implicitly includes the htmlspecialchars
transformation. Where this is not desired, the "V" ("value") construct
can be used instead. ("X" = "V" + "H") To refer to the associated XML
document, both constructs use an XPath parameter such as
'general/title/string/@language'. There is a provision in 'xht'
allowing to include the callback marker '=/' in XPaths (see source
code).<br>
  </li>
  <li>As a convenience, the C, L, P, V, and X constructs allow
cascading instead of nesting, e.g. "<span class="code">{-V P xpath-}</span>"
is equivalent to "<span class="code">{-V {-P xpath-}-}</span>". </li>
  <li>For the "E" construct, see "Caching".<br>
  </li>
  <li>It should be kept in mind that template scanning and substitution
is simple character-processing. To help with template definition and
adaptation, 'xht' can generate tracing information that can be
made visible in the HTML page source (see xht_dbgn and xht_dbgo).</li>
  </small>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Mime types and Technical.Format</h2>
In the IEEE LOM standard, the metadata element Technical.Format must
contain the learning object mime type. DMD1.6 uses
DocumentManager::file_get_mime_type as authorative source for mime
types and for determining the default mime type based on file extension.<br>
<br>
There is a provision for adding mime types that are not listed in
DocumentManager::file_get_mime_type,
for example alternative mime types for a specific file extension. This
is done via the language variable $langFormats (see DLTT and Dokeos
lang-file md_document). This language variable must contain an
associative list such as e.g. "<span class="code">:text/plain;iso-8859-1:Text;Latin-1,,
application/xml;iso-8859-1:Xml;Latin-1</span>". (The second part of a
list
item, e.g. "<span class="code">Text;Latin-1</span>", appears in the
selection box in the metadata
screen and can be made language-specific.) (In associative lists,
elements are separated by double comma; value and language text are
separated by the first character in the language string, here a colon.)<br>
<br>
One specific mime type can be designated as the mime type for course
keywords documents (see next section). This is done by defining
parameter XML in the template file metadata/md_document.htt. In DMD1.6
it contains:<br>
<span class="code">{-D XML application/xml;iso-8859-1-}</span><br>
<br>
<h2>Keywords in a tree, JavaScript<br>
</h2>
MD usually includes
keywords, and there is a special provision in
DMD1.6 allowing to (optionally) define a structured set of keywords for
each course. The course manager defines the keywords in an xml file (an
example is provided) and uploads it to the course documents area. When
browsing to that document's metadata, there will be a button 'This
document contains the course keywords'. The
XML-structured keywordtree is then converted to the cache file
'CourseKwds.js'
in the course's top-level directory. The button must be used after each
change to the xml file. To remove all course keywords (and the cache
file), use the button on an xml file containing only spaces or only a
top element with no content.<br>
<br>
The cache file constructs a clickable tree
in HTML (restricted to W3C browsers). The toolkit script 'md_funcs'
contains the server-side functions related to the keyword tree, the
file 'md_script.js' contains
the client-side script.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Whether the keyword tree is
presented in a screen (index, search, ...), and if so, where and how,
can again be defined relatively easily via the templates. The MD
view-and-edit screen also converts comma-separated keywords (whether
selected with the clickable tree or typed in)
to separate XML elements (as required by SCORM 1.3).<br>
<br>
The file 'md_script.js' also contains the client-side script used by
the HTML templates in 'md_document.htt' for input validation and MD
update preparation in screens for 'Document'-type object MD. Whereas
keyword-tree clicking requires a W3C browser, input validation and MD
update should also work with IE4 and NS4 browsers (not tested).<br>
<br>
DMD1.6 contains input validation of two kinds (put the following on the
HTML INPUT element):<br>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code">onKeyPress="return
isValidChar(event, pattern, flags)"</span>, e.g. '[a-z]', 'i': allow
only the
26*2 letters: all other input is disabled in the INPUT field; examples
in the fields for the learning object identifier and for keywords;</li>
  <li><span class="code">onKeyUp="checkValid(this,
pattern, flags)"</span>, e.g. '^[a-z]{2,8}$', 'i': field must contain
between 2
and 8 letters: nonconforming input will pass, but text is rendered in
red to alert the user; an example in the date field (lng. obj.
creation).</li>
</ul>
To provide a minimum level of MD editing support when there is no
scripting in the browser, the templates in 'md_editxml' allow direct
editing of the XML formatted data. (This same template is used should
an XML syntax error be detected, thereby allowing to repair XML
metadata.)<br>
<br>
To view the XML formatted data, click the 'Store' button while holding
CTRL- and ALT-keys down.<br>
<br>
The server-side functions for the construction of the keyword tree
cache file (in 'md_funcs')
mimic an XSLT process which is
documented in 'SelKwds.xsl'. (This file, and XSLT in general, is not
used in DMD1.6.)<br>
<br>
The experimental script 'statistics.php' gives statistics about the
usage of course keywords. It is not linked to any Dokeos
1.6 screen, therefore not reachable in a standard installation.<br>
<br>
<h2>MD toolkit and API<br>
</h2>
The script 'md_funcs' contains the main part of the toolkit and API.
They allow other Dokeos scripts to define, modify and delete MD for
specific objects (see class 'mdstore'). The script 'md_funcs' must be
combined with a script
that defines the object class 'mdobject' for the specific type of
object
(such as&nbsp; 'md_document.php' for 'Document'-type objects). The test
scripts 'dcex' and 'mdApiTest' demonstrate the toolkit and the API
functions.<br>
<br>
The simplest way of working with the API is by using the functions
'mds_get_dc_elements' and 'mds_put_dc_elements'. They allow to fetch
and store the MD elements that are part of the so called Dublin Core.
The DC elements form a generally accepted core set of metadata.<br>
<br>
The function 'mds_update_xml_and_mdt' is particularly useful for
translating user interactions with a MD edit screen to MD-store
operations. When using the API, it might be more handy to work with xmd
and mdstore operations directly.<br>
<br>
A word of warning: MD scanning is a relatively compute-intensive task.
If used in a loop, e.g. to display some specific info about several
hundreds of documents, server response might slow down.<br>
<br>
<h2>Other files in DMD1.6</h2>
Language files
'md_document.inc.php' are available for English, French and Dutch.
Language files 'md_link.inc.php' and 'md_scorm.inc.php' only exist in
English.<br>
<br>
Files 'md_link.php' and 'md_link.htt', also 'md_scorm.php' and
'md_scorm.htt', all already mentioned, are used in
conjunction with the not fully supported functionality related to Link
metadata
and SCORM
package metadata import.<br>
<br>
File 'md_link.php', in conjunction with 'index.php', demonstrates the
use of the mdo_override and mdo_storeback methods allowing to implement
a more tight synchronization between MD and standard Dokeos object
properties than is actually implemented for document MD (see also
below: Link metadata editing).<br>
<br>
<h2>Caching</h2>
The 'xht' library provides caching functions, which allow to speed up
screen building. DMD1.6 caches information to database fields
'htmlcache1' and 'indexabletext' ('htmlcache2' is not used in DMD1.6).<br>
<br>
In 'md_document.htt' it can be seen that the MD view-and-edit screen
(produced by index.php) is divided in four main parts: part 1, the
keywords tree,
part 2 and the POST form.<br>
<br>
Instead of a normal "call" from a template to a subtemplate, which
would be "<span class="code">{-C METADATA_PART1-}</span>", the main
template does an "escape-call" "<span class="code">{-E
md_part1 C METADATA_PART1-}</span>". The escape construct works as
follows: the
'xht' library does a callback to the user code, in this example to the
PHP
function 'md_part1'. The code for that function can be found in
'index.php'.
That function checks whether it has a valid cached HTML and if so,
returns
it, thereby avoiding the template expansion of the subtemplate
METADATA_PART1.
If not, 'xht' effectively does the (supposedly slow) expansion and
allows
the callback function 'md_part1' to store it for re-use.<br>
<br>
In DMD1.6, "part 1" of the screen contains most template expansion
work, hence the database field 'htmlcache1' is a real HTML cache.
Another part of the screen is made to contain the "words" from the
metadata that must
be indexable and searchable. It corresponds with the database
field 'indexabletext'.<br>
<br>
Under certain circumstances, caching may cause a delay after a change.
For example, when making languages visible or unvisible, they may not
immediately appear in or disappear from the SELECT inputfields in
existing metadata. To make the change visible, edit that metadata.<br>
<br>
Toolkit/API functions such as
'mds_append', useful e.g. for adding searchable words to
'indexabletext', must be used with care, because of possible
interactions with the index
script, when it allows users to modify metadata (and therefore also
indexable words) interactively.<br>
<br>
<h2>Index and Search scripts<br>
</h2>
Both scripts lean heavily on the libraries and on the API;
they are therefore relatively short.<br>
<br>
Note that all output is produced in a section at the end of the scripts.<br>
<br>
DMD1.6 has an experimental screen for searching documents based on
their MD. It is not linked to any Dokeos
1.6 screen, therefore not reachable in a standard installation.<br>
<br>
This MD search screen described in this section does not require the
installation of PhpDig 1.8.6. as opposed to the (not fully supported)
PhpDig indexing/searching scripts described further down.<br>
<br>
A general search in all metadata is not so easy,
because the metadata can in theory be quite different for different
types of
Dokeos objects. In practice, Dokeos platforms will probably stick to
identical or rather similar metadata for all objects and might
therefore find the search script useful.<br>
<br>
The DMD1.6 MD search script does an unsophisticated database query in
field 'indexabletext', supposedly containing all searchable words.<br>
<br>
DMD1.6 puts these searchable words in the field:
<ul>
  <li>via function md_indexabletext in index.php if that function is
called from the templates in a "E" construct (see Caching); this is the
case for Document;</li>
  <li>for Scorm and Link: via function mdo_define_htt in md_scorm.php
and md_link.php, called by
importmanifest.php and importlinks.php.</li>
</ul>
Note that keywords are transformed, e.g. MD keyword 'fish' will become
searchable word 'fish-kw'. This allows search to focus on the keyword,
without finding references where the word 'fish' is part of some
description. This can of course (because of the templates) be changed
relatively easily, but it should be noted that the current search
screen &amp; script, and also the PhpDig connection, assume this
transformation.<br>
<br>
The script
'update_indexabletext.php' can be used to update MD records when the
definition of the searchable words is changed. It is not linked to any Dokeos
1.6 screen, therefore not reachable in a standard installation. It uses
function mdo_define_htt already mentioned above. For documents,
md_document.php should then contain the same definition as the one in
md_document.htt. Use the script with e.g. '?eid_type=Document'.<br>
The SCORM package metadata import script importmanifest.php (see
below), if used with SCORM
2004 packages, generates metadata records (type 'Scorm') that are very
similar to the 'Document' type metadata records.<br>
<br>
Before generating output, search combines (in memory) the XML metadata
of all
Dokeos objects that it has found for a particular query into a big,
imsmanifest-like XML document. It is expected that this will cause
problems if many hundreds or thousands of objects have metadata and can
therefore be "found" in one query.<br>
<br>
All of this shows that the search script will need to evolve in future
Dokeos versions.<br>
<br>
To make metadata search available on your Dokeos server, include a link
to <br>
<span class="code">.../metadata/search.php?type=Mix
</span><br>
<br>
<h2>DMD1.6 files with comments</h2>
<h3>Updates for standard Dokeos scripts</h3>
<h4>document/edit_document.php</h4>
The (one and only) link between Dokeos and metadata (via Documents).<br>
<h4>lang/*/document.inc.php</h4>
Two additional language-dependent words for edit_document.<br>
<h4>inc/lib/fileManage.lib.php</h4>
Updated to delete the metadata entry when deleting a document or a
SCORM folder. (Link-MD is not automatically deleted.)<br>
<br>
<h2>Functionality not fully
supported in DMD1.6</h2>
<h3>Link metadata editing</h3>
To allow course managers to interactively store and edit metadata about
a Link, provide an URL such as:<br>
<span class="code">.../metadata/?eid=Link.nnn</span><br>
<br>
This metadata may e.g. add keywords.<br>
<br>
Unlike with Document-type objects, Link-type metadata object editing
has an override- and storeback-functionality. When metadata is
displayed for editing, DB data is overridden by new data from the Links
table (but not automatically stored): category, url, title,
description, keywords. When metadata is changed in the MD edit screen
and stored, then new data is stored back into the Links table: url,
title, description, keywords (but not category).<br>
<br>
In the Links table, MD description and keywords are combined in the
description field, as follows:<br>
<span class="code">&lt;i kw="kw1, kw2, ..."&gt;Description&lt;/i&gt;</span><br>
Thereby keywords are not visible to the user, yet editable by the
course admin.<br>
<h4>importlinks.php</h4>
This script, not reachable
until you e.g. link it to a course homepage,
performs the following operations
related to Links:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create MTEs (Metadata
Table Entries) for all Links of a specific category</li>
  <li>Delete all MTEs for
Links of a specific category</li>
  <li>Index all MTEs of a
Link category for search (see also below, PhpDig connection)</li>
</ul>
As importlinks is meant to be used only by course admins, hide
it after you have linked it to the course homepage.<br>
<br>
<h3>SCORM metadata import and custom browsing</h3>
<h4>importmanifest.php</h4>
This script, not reachable until you e.g. link it to a course homepage,
performs the following operations
related to Metadata Table Entries (MTEs) and SCORM package directories
(SPDs) in Learning Path (which have a SCORM Directory Id SDI):
<ul>
  <li>Import or re-import the 'imsmanifest.xml' file from a SPD into
MTEs</li>
  <li>Find the SDI of some SPD</li>
  <li>Delete all MTEs corresponding to a specific SDI</li>
  <li>Show the main MTE corresponding to some SDI (after import)</li>
  <li>Start 'index.php' in some SPD (after import)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Index some SPD for search (see also below, PhpDig connection)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Note that the above mentioned 'index.php' in the SPD is created by
import.<br>
<br>
As importmanifest is meant to be used only by course admins, hide
it after you have linked it to the course homepage.<br>
<h4>playscormmdset.inc.php</h4>
This include-script contains the main functionality of the custom
browser.<br>
<br>
Import creates an 'index.php' in the corresponding scorm folder of a
course. It includes 'playscormmdset'.<br>
<br>
(Thereby to a search engine, the custom browser will appear as if it is
located in that scorm folder. This is important for search engines that
allow to index/re-index by virtual directory.)<br>
<br>
The custom browser uses a templates file to generate HTML, but unlike
the standard MD screens, it looks for that templates file in the scorm
folder or in its parent folders. Thereby the generated HTML can be
different for different scorm folders.
<br>
An example templates file can be found in metadata/doc/mdp_scorm.htt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>PhpDig connection</h3>
DMD1.6 includes functionality
allowing a specific course to work with a customized version of PhpDig
1.8.6 that has been built into the course. This provides quicker and
more
sophisticated search functionality.<br>
<br>
The connection consists of the script 'md_phpdig.php', this document
section, and the customized files in ...main/metadata/phpdig.<br>
<br>
It is assumed that a system admin installs a copy of PhpDig in a
subfolder 'phpdig-1.8.6' of the course webfolder, customizes it as
described below and by the sample files, and initializes it by running
PhpDig's install script.<br>
<br>
The admin screen of PhpDig can best be defined as a hidden
link (because course-admin only) in the course homepage. A link in a
separate window is best, as the admin screen has no Dokeos header.<br>
<br>
Script 'md_phpdig.php' contains a few lines copied from the PhpDig
config script and a set of functions that can be used as API functions
providing a PhpDig DB-feeder mechanism. They allow combinations of URLs
and searchable words to be fed into the DB directly, bypassing the
PhpDig spider script. The API code is PhpDig spider code, covered by
the GNU GPL just like PhpDig is.<br>
<br>
Scripts 'importdocs.php', 'importlinks.php' and
'importmanifest.php' make use of that API to index MD for PhpDig. None
of them are reachable from standard Dokeos 1.6 screens.<br>
<br>
The PhpDig Search screen, which can be used instead of the experimental
MD search screen, is the custom 'search.php' available in the
metadata/phpdig folder. It must be copied to the 'phpdig-1.8.6'
subfolder of the
course webfolder and then made reachable from the course homepage.<br>
<br>
PhpDig by default combines search terms with AND and searches for words
starting with the search term strings. Negation is done by putting a
hyphen before the search term (implemented as ALT-click in the search
screen keyword tree).<br>

replaced (twice) by<br>
<span class="code">' \'._~@#$&amp;%/=-]+' no :;, in words</span><br>
<h5>search.php</h5>
This is the script that must be made accessible in the course, to
provide PhpDig search. It is a newly developed script replacing
PhpDig's standard one.<br>
<br>
Course managers can adapt the search form and provide extra search
criteria as explained in the SearchableImageWebsite document mentioned
above.<br>
<h5>libs/search_function</h5>
<span class="code">" \'.\_~@#$:&amp;\%/;,=-]+"</span>
replaced by<br>
<span class="code">" \'._~@#$&amp;%/=-]+" no \:;, in words<br>
<br>
two special "words" are used for controlling the displaying of the
search results: "txt-sep" (newline) and "txt-end" (end of display)<br>
<br>
the "-kw" tail of keywords is stripped off in the search results</span><br>
<h5>thumbnail support</h5>
This is quite well explained in the above mentioned background material.<br>
<br>
This works only with special-design SCORM packages: item resource
file[1]/@href is assumed to point to the thumbnail image, which must
have a filename 'pptsl' + nnn + '_t.jpg' (see a.o.
'importmanifest.php').<br>
<br>
In md_phpdig.php, the '&amp;thumb=...' part of URLs is cut off for
display.<br>
<br>
Metadata search also displays the thumbs (see
'.../main/metadata/search.php' and 'mds_mix.htt').
